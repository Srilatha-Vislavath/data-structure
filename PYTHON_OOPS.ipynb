        "A. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions or logic. Objects represent real-world entities and combine data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit. OOP promotes concepts like encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (creating new classes from existing ones), polymorphism (using a unified interface for different data types), and abstraction (hiding complex details). This approach makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

Attributes prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., _var) are treated as protected by convention, while those with double underscores (e.g., __var) use name mangling to make them harder to access directly, simulating private variables. Although Python does not enforce strict access restrictions, these practices, along with getter and setter methods or property decorators, help safeguard data and promote controlled interaction with an object’s attributes."
